A simple plugin that makes storing duration as total seconds easier.  For situations where you need to store durations such as total time spent running the marathon etc.

has_duration :column_name where column_name is the column you want to store the total number of seconds in

Then in your table you need to define the following extra columns: column_name_hours, column_name_minutes, column_name_seconds

Example:

class Workout
  has_duration :duration, :allow_nil => false
end

Then in your forms you can do what you would expect such as

Duration: <%=f.text_field :duration_hours %> <%= f.text_field :duration_minutes %> <% f.text_field :duration_seconds %> (HH:MM:SS)

Controller
def create
  @workout.new(params[:workout])
  if @workout.save # calculates the total seconds based on the parameters and stores it in the duration column
    ...
  end
end

The plugin validates the numericality of each column. For minutes and seconds it also makes sure its less than 59

TODO:
- Pass on more validates_numericality_of options
- Look into possibility of not needing the the extra columns
